The Less Waste Game
===

The concept is pretty simple, take 3-5 ordinary bathroom scales and attach a Raspberry PI 2 to them. Do a bit of code, and viola you have a simple system that weighs your trash vs your recyclables (and/or) compostables then provides you with a runny tally and score. Of course there is a bit more to it than this, but this is the basic idea.
